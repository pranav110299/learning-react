1] Passing a Variable to ReactDOM.render() :
eg =
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Write code here:
const myList = (
  <ul>
  <li>batting</li>
  <li>bowling</li>
  </ul>
);
ReactDOM.render(myList,document.getElementById('app'));

2] Self-Closing Tags : When you write a self-closing tag in HTML, it is optional to include a forward-slash immediately before the final angle-bracket. But!

In JSX, you have to include the slash. If you write a self-closing tag in JSX and forget the slash, you will raise an error.
eg = const profile = (
  <div>
    <h1>I AM JENKINS</h1>
    <img src="images/jenkins.png" />
    <article>
      I LIKE TO SIT
      <br />
      JENKINS IS MY NAME
      <br />
      THANKS HA LOT
    </article>
  </div>
);
